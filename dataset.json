The **eyebrows** are significantly filled and defined, appearing fuller, darker, and more arched than their natural state. Eye makeup is intricate: a deeper, smoky **eyeshadow** shade (possibly plum or charcoal) is applied to the outer V and crease, blended into a lighter, shimmery shade on the mobile lid, with a bright inner corner highlight. **Eyeliner** is precisely applied along the upper lash line with a subtle wing, and also on the lower lash line and waterline for increased definition. Lashes are volumized and lengthened, appearing significantly fuller, likely with mascara and false eyelashes. The **lips** are transformed with a warm, peachy-pink **lipstick** and a high-shine **gloss**, appearing fuller and more defined, possibly with the aid of **lip liner**.",
  "186": "The 'after' image showcases a complete makeup application that significantly enhances the person's features.

The eyes are dramatically enhanced with a multi-tonal eyeshadow look featuring warm brown and bronze shades blended into the crease and outer V for depth, a lighter shimmery shade on the mobile lid, and an inner corner highlight to brighten. A sharp black liquid eyeliner defines the upper lash line with a subtle wing, while the lower lash line is softly smudged with a darker shadow and tight-lined with a dark pencil.

The face shows subtle contouring along the cheekbones to add definition and warmth, complemented by a peachy-pink blush applied to the apples of the cheeks, blending towards the temples. Highlighting is evident on the cheekbones, bridge of the nose, and cupid's bow, adding a radiant glow.

Eyebrows are expertly filled and shaped, appearing darker and more defined, beautifully framing the eyes. Cheeks are adorned with a soft, rosy-pink blush, applied to the apples and blended upwards, providing a healthy flush.

  "188": "The 'after' image showcases a comprehensive makeup application that dramatically transforms the subject's appearance from a natural, bare-faced look. Foundation has been applied to create a smoother, more even-toned complexion, effectively covering minor imperfections and reducing natural redness. The eyebrows have been significantly enhanced, appearing much darker, fuller, and more defined, especially in the arch and tail, contrasting with their lighter, natural state. For the eyes, a warm-toned eyeshadow, likely a reddish-brown or copper, has been blended across the eyelids and into the crease, extending outwards to create a smoky effect, with a darker shade intensifying the outer corners and lower lash line. A distinct black or dark brown eyeliner is visible on both the upper lash line, featuring a sharp winged or cat-eye extension, and the lower lash line, where it's applied to the waterline and smudged beneath the lashes. Eyelashes are dramatically lengthened, volumized, and darkened, indicating heavy mascara application and potentially false lashes. The cheeks show clear evidence of contouring applied beneath the cheekbones to add definition, complemented by a warm, rosy blush on the apples of the cheeks, blended upwards. Finally, the lips are transformed with a bold, vibrant, matte or semi-matte red lipstick that fully saturates and precisely defines their shape, creating a striking focal point compared to the natural, unadorned lips in the 'before' image.",

The **eyebrows** are filled in and meticulously shaped, appearing fuller, darker, and more arched than their natural state. For the eyes, a warm-toned **eyeshadow** palette featuring brown and possibly subtle plum shades is used, with a lighter, shimmery shade on the eyelid, a transition shade in the crease, and a darker shade defining the outer V and softly smoking out the lower lash line. A prominent black **winged eyeliner** creates a dramatic, lifted effect on the upper lash line. Significant **false eyelashes** are applied to the upper lid, adding considerable volume and length, while the lower lashes are also defined with mascara.
